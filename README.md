# Q&A with Larry Wall

At the Perl conference, [YAPC::NA](http://yapcna.org/), there will be a ninety
minute [question and answer session with Larry
Wall](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2015/event/1693).

[Larry Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) is the creator of Perl,
`rn`, `patch`, and other revolutionary monstrosities.  He's smart, funny, and
full of interesting things to say.  I will be acting as host, asking him
questions.  My goal is to have great questions that coax the most interesting
answers possible out of him.

You can help!

If you've got a topic or question you'd like asked, file an GitHub issue
or comment on an existing issue.  If you'd rather I keep your amazing question
close to my chest, or if you don't want to use GitHub, you can send me an email
at rjbs@cpan.org.
